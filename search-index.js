Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery has two primary components. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller and the cluster agents. These components work in a two-stage pull model. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller will pull from git and the cluster agents will pull from the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller is a set of Kubernetes controllers running in any standard Kubernetes cluster. The only API exposed by the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller is the Kubernetes API, there is no custom API for the fleet controller. One cluster agent runs in each cluster and is responsible for talking to the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller. The only communication from cluster to SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller is by this agent and all communication goes from the managed cluster to the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller. The fleet controller does not initiate connections to downstream clusters. This means managed clusters can run in private networks and behind NATs. The only requirement is the cluster agent needs to be able to communicate with the Kubernetes API of the cluster running the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller. The one exception to this is if you use the manager initiated cluster registration flow. This is not required, but an optional pattern. The cluster agents are not assumed to have an \"always on\" connection. They will resume operation as soon as they can connect. Future enhancements will probably add the ability to schedule times of when the agent checks in, as it stands right now they will always attempt to connect. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller dynamically creates service accounts, manages their RBAC and then gives the tokens to the downstream clusters. Clusters are registered by optionally expiring cluster registration tokens. The cluster registration token is used only during the registration process to generate a credential specific to that cluster. After the cluster credential is established the cluster \"forgets\" the cluster registration token. The service accounts given to the clusters only have privileges to list BundleDeployment in the namespace created specifically for that cluster. It can also update the status subresource of BundleDeployment and the status subresource of it’s Cluster resource.

In most cases Bundles should not be created manually by the user. If you want to deploy resources from a git repository use a GitRepo instead. If you want to deploy resources without a git repository follow this guide to create a Bundle. When creating a GitRepo SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery will fetch the resources from a git repository, and add them to a Bundle. When creating a Bundle resources need to be explicitly specified in the Bundle Spec. Resources can be compressed with gz. See here an example of how Rancher uses compression in go code. If you would like to deploy in downstream clusters, you need to define targets. Targets work similarly to targets in GitRepo. See Mapping to Downstream Clusters. The following example creates a nginx Deployment in the local cluster: kind: Bundle apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 metadata: # Any name can be used here name: my-bundle # For single cluster use fleet-local, otherwise use the namespace of # your choosing namespace: fleet-local spec: resources: # List of all resources that will be deployed - content: | apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx-deployment labels: app: nginx spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: nginx template: metadata: labels: app: nginx spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:1.14.2 ports: - containerPort: 80 name: nginx.yaml targets: - clusterName: local The bundle can target multiple clusters. It uses the same targeting as the GitRepo. Additional customization options can be specified per target: targets: - clusterSelector: matchLabels: env: dev defaultNamespace: lab-1 helm: values: replicas: 1 Helm options related to downloading the helm chart will be ignored. The helm chart is downloaded by the fleet-cli, which creates the bundles. The bundle has to contain all the resources from the chart. Therefore the bundle will ignore: spec.helm.repo spec.helm.charts You can’t use a fleet.yaml in resources, it is only used by the fleet-cli to create bundles. The spec.targetRestrictions field is not useful, as it is an allow list for targets specified in spec.targets. It is not needed, since targets are explicitly given in a bundle and an empty targetRestrictions defaults to allow. You can use the Fleet CLI to convert a Helm chart into a bundle. For example, you can download and convert the \"external secrets\" operator chart like this: cat > targets.yaml app/fleet.yaml eso-bundle.yaml kubectl apply -f eso-bundle.yaml Make sure you use a cluster selector in targets.yaml, that matches all clusters you want to deploy to. The blog post on Fleet: Multi-Cluster Deployment with the Help of External Secrets has more information.","title":"Create a Bundle Resource","component":"continuous-delivery","version":"v0.12","name":"bundle-add","url":"/continuous-delivery/v0.12/en/bundle-add.html","titles":[{"text":"Targets","hash":"_targets","id":1},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"_limitations","id":2},{"text":"Convert a Helm Chart into a Bundle","hash":"_convert_a_helm_chart_into_a_bundle","id":3}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Continuous Delivery in Rancher is powered by fleet. When a user adds a GitRepo CR, then Continuous Delivery creates the associated fleet bundles. You can access these bundles by navigating to the Cluster Explorer (Dashboard UI), and selecting the Bundles section. The bundled charts may have some objects that are amended at runtime, for example in ValidatingWebhookConfiguration the caBundle is empty and the CA cert is injected by the cluster. This leads the status of the bundle and associated GitRepo to be reported as \"Modified\" Associated Bundle SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery bundles support the ability to specify a custom jsonPointer patch. With the patch, users can instruct fleet to ignore object modifications. In this simple example, we create a Service and ConfigMap that we apply a bundle diff onto. https://github.com/rancher/fleet-test-data/tree/master/bundle-diffs In this example, we are trying to deploy opa-gatekeeper using Continuous Delivery to our clusters. The opa-gatekeeper bundle associated with the opa GitRepo is in modified state. Each path in the GitRepo CR, has an associated Bundle CR. The user can view the Bundles, and the associated diff needed in the Bundle status. In our case the differences detected are as follows: summary: desiredReady: 1 modified: 1 nonReadyResources: - bundleState: Modified modifiedStatus: - apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration name: gatekeeper-validating-webhook-configuration patch: '{\"$setElementOrder/webhooks\":[{\"name\":\"validation.gatekeeper.sh\"},{\"name\":\"check-ignore-label.gatekeeper.sh\"}],\"webhooks\":[{\"clientConfig\":{\"caBundle\":\"Cg==\"},\"name\":\"validation.gatekeeper.sh\",\"rules\":[{\"apiGroups\":[\"*\"],\"apiVersions\":[\"*\"],\"operations\":[\"CREATE\",\"UPDATE\"],\"resources\":[\"*\"]}]},{\"clientConfig\":{\"caBundle\":\"Cg==\"},\"name\":\"check-ignore-label.gatekeeper.sh\",\"rules\":[{\"apiGroups\":[\"\"],\"apiVersions\":[\"*\"],\"operations\":[\"CREATE\",\"UPDATE\"],\"resources\":[\"namespaces\"]}]}]}' - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: gatekeeper-audit namespace: cattle-gatekeeper-system patch: '{\"spec\":{\"template\":{\"spec\":{\"$setElementOrder/containers\":[{\"name\":\"manager\"}],\"containers\":[{\"name\":\"manager\",\"resources\":{\"limits\":{\"cpu\":\"1000m\"}}}],\"tolerations\":[]}}}}' - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: gatekeeper-controller-manager namespace: cattle-gatekeeper-system patch: '{\"spec\":{\"template\":{\"spec\":{\"$setElementOrder/containers\":[{\"name\":\"manager\"}],\"containers\":[{\"name\":\"manager\",\"resources\":{\"limits\":{\"cpu\":\"1000m\"}}}],\"tolerations\":[]}}}}' Based on this summary, there are three objects which need to be patched. We will look at these one at a time. The gatekeeper-validating-webhook-configuration validating webhook has two ValidatingWebhooks in its spec. In cases where more than one element in the field requires a patch, that patch will refer these to as $setElementOrder/ELEMENTNAME From this information, we can see the two ValidatingWebhooks in question are: \"$setElementOrder/webhooks\": [ { \"name\": \"validation.gatekeeper.sh\" }, { \"name\": \"check-ignore-label.gatekeeper.sh\" } ], Within each ValidatingWebhook, the fields that need to be ignore are as follows: { \"clientConfig\": { \"caBundle\": \"Cg==\" }, \"name\": \"validation.gatekeeper.sh\", \"rules\": [ { \"apiGroups\": [ \"*\" ], \"apiVersions\": [ \"*\" ], \"operations\": [ \"CREATE\", \"UPDATE\" ], \"resources\": [ \"*\" ] } ] }, and { \"clientConfig\": { \"caBundle\": \"Cg==\" }, \"name\": \"check-ignore-label.gatekeeper.sh\", \"rules\": [ { \"apiGroups\": [ \"\" ], \"apiVersions\": [ \"*\" ], \"operations\": [ \"CREATE\", \"UPDATE\" ], \"resources\": [ \"namespaces\" ] } ] } In summary, we need to ignore the fields rules and clientConfig.caBundle in our patch specification. The field webhook in the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration spec is an array, so we need to address the elements by their index values. Based on this information, our diff patch would look as follows: - apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration name: gatekeeper-validating-webhook-configuration operations: - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\":\"/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\":\"/webhooks/0/rules\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\":\"/webhooks/1/clientConfig/caBundle\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\":\"/webhooks/1/rules\"} The gatekeeper-controller-manager deployment is modified since there are cpu limits and tolerations applied (which are not in the actual bundle). { \"spec\": { \"template\": { \"spec\": { \"$setElementOrder/containers\": [ { \"name\": \"manager\" } ], \"containers\": [ { \"name\": \"manager\", \"resources\": { \"limits\": { \"cpu\": \"1000m\" } } } ], \"tolerations\": [] } } } } In this case, there is only 1 container in the deployment container spec, and that container has cpu limits and tolerations added. Based on this information, our diff patch would look as follows: - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: gatekeeper-controller-manager namespace: cattle-gatekeeper-system operations: - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/resources/limits/cpu\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/tolerations\"} The gatekeeper-audit deployment is modified in a similarly, to the gatekeeper-controller-manager, with additional cpu limits and tolerations applied. { \"spec\": { \"template\": { \"spec\": { \"$setElementOrder/containers\": [ { \"name\": \"manager\" } ], \"containers\": [ { \"name\": \"manager\", \"resources\": { \"limits\": { \"cpu\": \"1000m\" } } } ], \"tolerations\": [] } } } } Similar to gatekeeper-controller-manager, there is only 1 container in the deployments container spec, and that has cpu limits and tolerations added. Based on this information, our diff patch would look as follows: - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: gatekeeper-audit namespace: cattle-gatekeeper-system operations: - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/resources/limits/cpu\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/tolerations\"} We can now combine all these patches as follows: diff: comparePatches: - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: gatekeeper-audit namespace: cattle-gatekeeper-system operations: - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/resources/limits/cpu\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/tolerations\"} - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: gatekeeper-controller-manager namespace: cattle-gatekeeper-system operations: - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/resources/limits/cpu\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/tolerations\"} - apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration name: gatekeeper-validating-webhook-configuration operations: - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\":\"/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\":\"/webhooks/0/rules\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\":\"/webhooks/1/clientConfig/caBundle\"} - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\":\"/webhooks/1/rules\"} We can add these now to the bundle directly to test and also commit the same to the fleet.yaml in your GitRepo.

These styles will be referred to as agent-initiated and manager-initiated registration. Typically one would go with the agent-initiated registration but there are specific use cases in which manager-initiated is a better workflow. Agent-initiated refers to a pattern in which the downstream cluster installs an agent with a cluster registration token and optionally a client ID. The cluster agent will then make a API request to the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager and initiate the registration process. Using this process the Manager will never make an outbound API request to the downstream clusters and will thus never need to have direct network access. The downstream cluster only needs to make outbound HTTPS calls to the manager. Manager-initiated registration is a process in which you register an existing Kubernetes cluster with the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager and the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager will make an API call to the downstream cluster to deploy the agent. This style can place additional network access requirements because the Fleet manager must be able to communicate with the downstream cluster API server for the registration process. After the cluster is registered there is no further need for the manager to contact the downstream cluster API. This style is more compatible if you wish to manage the creation of all your Kubernetes clusters through GitOps using something like cluster-api or Rancher. A downstream cluster is registered by installing an agent via helm and using the cluster registration token and optionally a client ID or cluster labels. It’s not necessary to configure the fleet manager for multi cluster, as the downstream agent we install via Helm will connect to the Kubernetes API of the upstream cluster directly. Agent-initiated registration is normally not used with Rancher. The cluster registration token is a credential that will authorize the downstream cluster agent to be able to initiate the registration process. This is required. The cluster registration token is manifested as a values.yaml file that will be passed to the helm install process. Alternatively one can pass the token directly to the helm install command via --set token=\"$token\". There are two styles of registering an agent. You can have the cluster for this agent dynamically created, in which case you will probably want to specify cluster labels upon registration. Or you can have the agent register to a predefined cluster in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager, in which case you will need a client ID. The former approach is typically the easiest. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery agent is installed as a Helm chart. Following are explanations how to determine and set its parameters. First, follow the cluster registration token instructions to obtain the values.yaml which contains the registration token to authenticate against the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery cluster. Second, optionally you can define labels that will assigned to the newly created cluster upon registration. After registration is completed an agent cannot change the labels of the cluster. To add cluster labels add --set-string labels.KEY=VALUE to the below Helm command. To add the labels foo=bar and bar=baz then you would add --set-string labels.foo=bar --set-string labels.bar=baz to the command line. # Leave blank if you do not want any labels CLUSTER_LABELS=\"--set-string labels.example=true --set-string labels.env=dev\" Third, set variables with the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery cluster’s API Server URL and CA, for the downstream cluster to use for connecting. API_SERVER_URL=https://:6443 API_SERVER_CA_DATA=... If the API server is not listening on the https port (443), the API_SERVER_URL should include the port, e.g. https://:6443. The URL can be found in the .kube/config file. Value in API_SERVER_CA_DATA can be obtained from a .kube/config file with valid data to connect to the upstream cluster (under the certificate-authority-data key). Alternatively it can be obtained from within the upstream cluster itself, by looking up the default ServiceAccount secret name (typically prefixed with default-token-, in the default namespace), under the ca.crt key. Use proper namespace and release name: For the agent chart the namespace must be cattle-fleet-system and the release name fleet-agent Kubectl Context Ensure you are installing to the right cluster: Helm will use the default context in ${HOME}/.kube/config to deploy the agent. Use --kubeconfig and --kube-context to change which cluster Helm is installing to. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in Rancher Rancher has separate helm charts for SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery and uses a different repository. Add Fleet’s Helm repo. helm repo add fleet https://rancher.github.io/fleet-helm-charts/ Finally, install the agent using Helm. Install Validate helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait \\ --set clientID=\"$CLUSTER_CLIENT_ID\" \\ --values values.yaml \\ fleet-agent fleet/fleet-agent You can check that status of the fleet pods by running the below commands: # Ensure kubectl is pointing to the right cluster kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system logs -l app=fleet-agent kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system get pods -l app=fleet-agent The agent should now be deployed. Additionally you should see a new cluster registered in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager. Below is an example of checking that a new cluster was registered in the clusters namespace. Please ensure your ${HOME}/.kube/config is pointed to the Fleet manager to run this command. kubectl -n clusters get clusters.fleet.cattle.io NAME BUNDLES-READY NODES-READY SAMPLE-NODE LAST-SEEN STATUS cluster-ab13e54400f1 1/1 1/1 k3d-cluster2-server-0 2020-08-31T19:23:10Z Client IDs are for the purpose of predefining clusters in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager with existing labels and repos targeted to them. A client ID is not required and is just one approach to managing clusters. The client ID is a unique string that will identify the cluster. This string is user generated and opaque to the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager and agent. It is assumed to be sufficiently unique. For security reasons one should not be able to easily guess this value as then one cluster could impersonate another. The client ID is optional and if not specified the UID field of the kube-system namespace resource will be used as the client ID. Upon registration if the client ID is found on a Cluster resource in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager it will associate the agent with that Cluster. If no Cluster resource is found with that client ID a new Cluster resource will be created with the specific client ID. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery agent is installed as a Helm chart. The only parameters to the helm chart installation should be the cluster registration token, which is represented by the values.yaml file and the client ID. The client ID is optional. First, create a Cluster in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Manager with the random client ID you have chosen. kind: Cluster apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 metadata: name: my-cluster namespace: clusters spec: clientID: \"really-random\" Second, follow the [cluster registration token instructions]((#create-cluster-registration-tokens) to obtain the values.yaml file to be used. Third, setup your environment to use the client ID. CLUSTER_CLIENT_ID=\"really-random\" Use proper namespace and release name: For the agent chart the namespace must be cattle-fleet-system and the release name fleet-agent Ensure you are installing to the right cluster: Helm will use the default context in ${HOME}/.kube/config to deploy the agent. Use --kubeconfig and --kube-context to change which cluster Helm is installing to.

Additionally you should see a new cluster registered in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager. Below is an example of checking that a new cluster was registered in the clusters namespace. Please ensure your ${HOME}/.kube/config is pointed to the Fleet manager to run this command. kubectl -n clusters get clusters.fleet.cattle.io NAME BUNDLES-READY NODES-READY SAMPLE-NODE LAST-SEEN STATUS my-cluster 1/1 1/1 k3d-cluster2-server-0 2020-08-31T19:23:10Z Not needed for Manager-initiated registration: For manager-initiated registrations the token is managed by the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager and does not need to be manually created and obtained. For an agent-initiated registration the downstream cluster must have a cluster registration token. Cluster registration tokens are used to establish a new identity for a cluster. Internally cluster registration tokens are managed by creating Kubernetes service accounts that have the permissions to create ClusterRegistrationRequests within a specific namespace. Once the cluster is registered a new ServiceAccount is created for that cluster that is used as the unique identity of the cluster. The agent is designed to forget the cluster registration token after registration. While the agent will not maintain a reference to the cluster registration token after a successful registration please note that usually other system bootstrap scripts do. Since the cluster registration token is forgotten, if you need to re-register a cluster you must give the cluster a new registration token. Cluster registration tokens can be reused by any cluster in a namespace. The tokens can be given a TTL such that it will expire after a specific time. The ClusterRegistationToken is a namespaced type and should be created in the same namespace in which you will create GitRepo and ClusterGroup resources. For in depth details on how namespaces are used in SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery refer to the documentation on namespaces. Create a new token with the below YAML. kind: ClusterRegistrationToken apiVersion: \"fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1\" metadata: name: new-token namespace: clusters spec: # A duration string for how long this token is valid for. A value values.yaml Once the values.yaml is ready it can be used repeatedly by clusters to register until the TTL expires. The manager-initiated registration flow is accomplished by creating a Cluster resource in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Manager that refers to a Kubernetes Secret containing a valid kubeconfig file in the data field called value. If you are using SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery standalone without Rancher, it must be installed as described in installation details. The manager-initiated registration is used when you add a cluster from the Rancher dashboard. The format of this secret is intended to match the format of the kubeconfig secret used in cluster-api. This means you can use cluster-api to create a cluster that is dynamically registered withSUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery. title=\"Kubeconfig Secret Example\" kind: Secret apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: my-cluster-kubeconfig namespace: clusters data: value: YXBpVmVyc2lvbjogdjEKY2x1c3RlcnM6Ci0gY2x1c3RlcjoKICAgIHNlcnZlcjogaHR0cHM6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbTo2NDQzCiAgbmFtZTogY2x1c3Rlcgpjb250ZXh0czoKLSBjb250ZXh0OgogICAgY2x1c3RlcjogY2x1c3RlcgogICAgdXNlcjogdXNlcgogIG5hbWU6IGRlZmF1bHQKY3VycmVudC1jb250ZXh0OiBkZWZhdWx0CmtpbmQ6IENvbmZpZwpwcmVmZXJlbmNlczoge30KdXNlcnM6Ci0gbmFtZTogdXNlcgogIHVzZXI6CiAgICB0b2tlbjogc29tZXRoaW5nCg== The cluster resource needs to reference the kubeconfig secret. title=\"Cluster Resource Example\" apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: my-cluster namespace: clusters labels: demo: \"true\" env: dev spec: kubeConfigSecret: my-cluster-kubeconfig","title":"Register Downstream Clusters","component":"continuous-delivery","version":"v0.12","name":"cluster-registration","url":"/continuous-delivery/v0.12/en/cluster-registration.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Agent-Initiated Registration","hash":"_agent_initiated_registration","id":2},{"text":"Manager-Initiated Registration","hash":"_manager_initiated_registration","id":3},{"text":"Agent Initiated","hash":"_agent_initiated","id":4},{"text":"Cluster Registration Token and Client ID","hash":"_cluster_registration_token_and_client_id","id":5},{"text":"Install Agent For a New Cluster","hash":"_install_agent_for_a_new_cluster","id":6},{"text":"Install Agent For a Predefined Cluster","hash":"_install_agent_for_a_predefined_cluster","id":7},{"text":"Create Cluster Registration Tokens","hash":"_create_cluster_registration_tokens","id":8},{"text":"Token TTL","hash":"_token_ttl","id":9},{"text":"Create a new Token","hash":"_create_a_new_token","id":10},{"text":"Obtaining Token Value (Agent values.yaml)","hash":"_obtaining_token_value_agent_values_yaml","id":11},{"text":"Manager Initiated","hash":"_manager_initiated","id":12},{"text":"Create Kubeconfig Secret","hash":"_create_kubeconfig_secret","id":13},{"text":"Create Cluster Resource","hash":"_create_cluster_resource","id":14}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery is fundamentally a set of Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) and controllers to manage GitOps for a single Kubernetes cluster or a large-scale deployment of Kubernetes clusters. For more on the naming conventions of CRDs, click here. Below are some of the concepts of SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery that will be useful throughout this documentation: SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Manager: The centralized component that orchestrates the deployments of Kubernetes assets from git. In a multi-cluster setup, this will typically be a dedicated Kubernetes cluster. In a single cluster setup, the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager will be running on the same cluster you are managing with GitOps. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller: The controller(s) running on the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager orchestrating GitOps. In practice, the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager and SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controllers are used fairly interchangeably. Single Cluster Style: This is a style of installing SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in which the manager and downstream cluster are the same cluster. This is a very simple pattern to quickly get up and running with GitOps. Multi Cluster Style: This is a style of running SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in which you have a central manager that manages a large number of downstream clusters. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery agent: Every managed downstream cluster will run an agent that communicates back to the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager. This agent is just another set of Kubernetes controllers running in the downstream cluster. GitRepo: Git repositories that are watched by SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery are represented by the type GitRepo. Example installation order via GitRepo custom resources when using SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery for the configuration management of downstream clusters: Install Calico CRDs and controllers. Set one or multiple cluster-level global network policies. Install GateKeeper. Note that cluster labels and overlays are critical features in SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery as they determine which clusters will get each part of the bundle. Set up and configure ingress and system daemons. Bundle: An internal unit used for the orchestration of resources from git. When a GitRepo is scanned it will produce one or more bundles. Bundles are a collection of resources that get deployed to a cluster. Bundle is the fundamental deployment unit used inSUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery. The contents of a Bundle may be Kubernetes manifests, Kustomize configuration, or Helm charts. Regardless of the source the contents are dynamically rendered into a Helm chart by the agent and installed into the downstream cluster as a helm release. To see the life cycle of a bundle, click here. BundleDeployment: When a Bundle is deployed to a cluster an instance of a Bundle is called a BundleDeployment. A BundleDeployment represents the state of that Bundle on a specific cluster with its cluster specific customizations. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery agent is only aware of BundleDeployment resources that are created for the cluster the agent is managing. For an example of how to deploy Kubernetes manifests across clusters using SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery customization, click here. Downstream Cluster: Clusters to which SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery deploys manifests are referred to as downstream clusters. In the single cluster use case, the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager Kubernetes cluster is both the manager and downstream cluster at the same time.

The available fields of the GitRepo custom resource are documented in the GitRepo resource reference Git repos are added to the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager using the GitRepo custom resource type. The GitRepo type is namespaced. By default, Rancher will create two SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery workspaces: fleet-default and fleet-local. fleet-default will contain all the downstream clusters that are already registered through Rancher. fleet-local will contain the local cluster by default. If you are using SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in a single cluster style, the namespace will always be fleet-local. Check here for more on the fleet-local namespace. For a multi-cluster style, please ensure you use the correct repo that will map to the right target clusters. The targetNamespace field will override any namespace in the bundle. If the deployment contains cluster scoped resources, it will fail. It takes precendence over all other namespace definitions: gitRepo.targetNamespace > fleet.yaml namespace > namespace in workload’s manifest > fleet.yaml defaultNamespace Workload namespace definitions can be restricted with allowedTargetNamespaces in the GitRepoRestriction resource. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery supports both HTTP and SSH auth keys for private repositories. To use this, you have to create a secret in the GitRepo’s namespace. For example, to generate a private SSH key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m pem -C \"user@email.com\" The private key format has to be in EC PRIVATE KEY, RSA PRIVATE KEY or PRIVATE KEY and should not contain a passphase. Put your private key into secret, use the namespace the GitRepo is in: kubectl create secret generic ssh-key -n fleet-default --from-file=ssh-privatekey=/file/to/private/key --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth Now the clientSecretName must be specified in the repo definition: apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 kind: GitRepo metadata: name: sample-ssh # This namespace is special and auto-wired to deploy to the local cluster namespace: fleet-local spec: # Everything from this repo will be run in this cluster.

The key has to be in PEM format. If you don’t add one or more public keys into the secret, any server’s public key will be trusted and added. (ssh -o stricthostkeychecking=accept-new will be used) SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery supports putting known_hosts into ssh secret.

Note that if secrets specifying CA bundles exist, for instance if Fleet is installed with Rancher (see the respective pages on Using a Private CA Signed Certificate and Additional Trusted CA’s), Fleet will use those CA bundles if no CA bundle is specified in the GitRepo. The credentials will be used unconditionally for all Helm repositories referenced by the gitrepo resource. Make sure you don’t leak credentials by mixing public and private repositories. Use different helm credentials for each path, or split them into different gitrepos, or use helmRepoURLRegex to limit the scope of credentials to certain servers. For a private Helm repo, users can reference a secret with the following keys: username and password for basic http auth if the Helm HTTP repo is behind basic auth. cacerts for custom CA bundle if the Helm repo is using a custom CA. Note that if secrets specifying CA bundles exist, for instance if Fleet is installed with Rancher (see the respective pages on Using a Private CA Signed Certificate and Additional Trusted CA’s), Fleet will use those CA bundles if no CA bundle is specified in the Helm secret. ssh-privatekey for ssh private key if repo is using ssh protocol. Private key with passphase is not supported currently. For example, to add a secret in kubectl, run kubectl create secret -n $namespace generic helm --from-literal=username=foo --from-literal=password=bar --from-file=cacerts=/path/to/cacerts --from-file=ssh-privatekey=/path/to/privatekey.pem After secret is created, specify the secret to gitRepo.spec.helmSecretName. Make sure secret is created under the same namespace with gitrepo. gitRepo.spec.helmSecretName will be ignored if gitRepo.spec.helmSecretNameForPaths is provided Create a file secrets-path.yaml that contains credentials for each path defined in a GitRepo. Credentials will not be used for paths that are not present in this file. The path is the actual path to the bundle (ie to a folder containing a fleet.yaml file) within the git repository, which might have more segments than the entry under paths:. Example: path-one: # path path-one must exist in the repository username: user password: pass path-two: # path path-one must exist in the repository username: user2 password: pass2 caBundle: 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 sshPrivateKey: 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 Create the secret kubectl create secret generic path-auth-secret -n fleet-default --from-file=secrets-path.yaml In the previous example credentials for username user will be used for the path path-one and credentials for username user2 will be used for the path path-two. caBundle and sshPrivateKey must be base64 encoded. If you are using \"rancher-backups\" and want this secret to be included the backup, please add the label resources.cattle.io/backup: true to the secret. In that case, make sure to encrypt the backup to protect sensitive credentials. It’s recommended not to store credentials in Git. Even if the repository is properly protected, the secrets are at risk when cloning, etc. As a workaround tools like SOPS can be used to encrypt the credentials. Instead it is recommended to reference secrets in the downstream cluster. For manifest-style and kustomize-style bundles this must be done in the manifests, e.g. by mounting the secrets or referencing them as environment variables. Helm-style bundles can use valuesFrom to read values from a secret in the downstream cluster. When using Kubernetes encryption at rest and storing credentials in Git, it is recommended to configure the upstream cluster to include several SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery CRDs in encryption resource list: - secrets - bundles.fleet.cattle.io - bundledeployments.fleet.cattle.io - contents.fleet.cattle.io Troubleshooting See SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Troubleshooting section here.","title":"Create a GitRepo Resource","component":"continuous-delivery","version":"v0.12","name":"gitrepo-add","url":"/continuous-delivery/v0.12/en/gitrepo-add.html","titles":[{"text":"Create GitRepo Instance","hash":"_create_gitrepo_instance","id":1},{"text":"Proper Namespace","hash":"_proper_namespace","id":2},{"text":"Override Workload’s Namespace","hash":"_override_workloads_namespace","id":3},{"text":"Adding A Private Git Repository","hash":"_adding_a_private_git_repository","id":4},{"text":"Known hosts","hash":"_known_hosts","id":5},{"text":"Using HTTP Auth","hash":"_using_http_auth","id":6},{"text":"Using Custom CA Bundles","hash":"_using_custom_ca_bundles","id":7},{"text":"Using Private Helm Repositories","hash":"_using_private_helm_repositories","id":8},{"text":"Use different helm credentials for each path","hash":"_use_different_helm_credentials_for_each_path","id":9},{"text":"Storing Credentials in Git","hash":"_storing_credentials_in_git","id":10}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery will create bundles from a git repository. This happens either explicitly by specifying paths, or when a fleet.yaml is found. Each bundle is created from paths in a GitRepo and modified further by reading the discovered fleet.yaml file. Bundle lifecycles are tracked between releases by the helm releaseName field added to each bundle. If the releaseName is not specified within fleet.yaml it is generated from GitRepo.name + path. Long names are truncated and a - prefix is added. The git repository has no explicitly required structure. It is important to realize the scanned resources will be saved as a resource in Kubernetes so you want to make sure the directories you are scanning in git do not contain arbitrarily large resources. Right now there is a limitation that the resources deployed must gzip to less than 1MB. Multiple paths can be defined for a GitRepo and each path is scanned independently. Internally each scanned path will become a bundle that SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery will manage, deploy, and monitor independently. The following files are looked for to determine the how the resources will be deployed. File Location Meaning Chart.yaml: / relative to path or custom path from fleet.yaml The resources will be deployed as a Helm chart. Refer to the fleet.yaml for more options. kustomization.yaml: / relative to path or custom path from fleet.yaml The resources will be deployed using Kustomize. Refer to the fleet.yaml for more options. fleet.yaml Any subpath If any fleet.yaml is found a new bundle will be defined. This allows mixing charts, kustomize, and raw YAML in the same repo *.yaml Any subpath If a Chart.yaml or kustomization.yaml is not found then any .yaml or .yml file will be assumed to be a Kubernetes resource and will be deployed. overlays/{name} / relative to path When deploying using raw YAML (not Kustomize or Helm) overlays is a special directory for customizations. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery supports file and directory exclusion by means of .fleetignore files, in a similar fashion to how .gitignore files behave in git repositories: Glob syntax is used to match files or directories, using Golang’s filepath.Match Empty lines are skipped, and can therefore be used to improve readability Characters like white spaces and # can be escaped with a backslash Trailing spaces are ignored, unless escaped Comments, ie lines starting with unescaped #, are skipped A given line can match a file or a directory, even if no separator is provided: eg. subdir/* and subdir are both valid .fleetignore lines, and subdir matches both files and directories called subdir A match may be found for a file or directory at any level below the directory where a .fleetignore lives, ie foo.yaml will match ./foo.yaml as well as ./path/to/foo.yaml Multiple .fleetignore files are supported. For instance, in the following directory structure, only root/something.yaml, bar/something2.yaml and foo/something.yaml will end up in a bundle: root/ ├── .fleetignore # contains `ignore-always.yaml' ├── something.yaml ├── bar │ ├── .fleetignore # contains `something.yaml` │ ├── ignore-always.yaml │ ├── something2.yaml │ └── something.yaml └── foo ├── ignore-always.yaml └── something.yaml This currently comes with a few limitations, the following not being supported: Double asterisks (**) Explicit inclusions with ! The fleet.yaml is an optional file that can be included in the git repository to change the behavior of how the resources are deployed and customized. The fleet.yaml is always at the root relative to the path of the GitRepo and if a subdirectory is found with a fleet.yaml a new bundle is defined that will then be configured differently from the parent bundle. Helm chart dependencies: It is up to the user to fulfill the dependency list for the Helm charts. As such, you must manually run helm dependencies update $chart OR run helm dependencies build $chart prior to install. See the Fleet docs in Rancher for more information. The available fields are documented in the fleet.yaml reference For a private Helm repo, users can reference a secret from the git repo resource. See Using Private Helm Repositories for more information. How changes are applied to values.yaml: Note that the most recently applied changes to the values.yaml will override any previously existing values. When changes are applied to the values.yaml from multiple sources at the same time, the values will update in the following order: helm.values -> helm.valuesFiles -> helm.valuesFrom. That means valuesFrom will take precedence over both, valuesFiles and values. The targeting step can treat the values as a template and fill in information from the clusters.fleet.cattle.io resource. More information can be found in Helm values templating. This can be turned off in fleet.yaml, by setting disablePreProcess, e.g. to avoid conflicts with other templating languages. Credentials in Values If the chart generates certificates or passwords in its templates, these values must be overriden. Otherwise the chart could be continuously deployed as these values change. Credentials loaded from the downstream cluster with valuesFrom are by default encrypted at rest, when data encryption is enabled in Kubernetes. Credentials contained in the default values.yaml file, or defined via values: or valuesFiles are not, as they are loaded from the repository when the bundle is created. Hardened clusters should add the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery CRDs to the list of resources encrypted at rest, on the upstream cluster, when storing credentials in the bundles. These examples showcase the style and format for using valuesFrom. ConfigMaps and Secrets should be created in downstream clusters. Example ConfigMap: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: configmap-values namespace: default data: values.yaml: |- replication: true replicas: 2 serviceType: NodePort Example Secret: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: secret-values namespace: default stringData: values.yaml: |- replication: true replicas: 3 serviceType: NodePort A secret like that, can be created from a YAML file secretdata.yaml by running the following kubectl command: kubectl create secret generic secret-values --from-file=values.yaml=secretdata.yaml The resources can then be referenced from a fleet.yaml: helm: chart: simple-chart valuesFrom: - secretKeyRef: name: secret-values namespace: default key: values.yaml - configMapKeyRef: name: configmap-values namespace: default key: values.yaml values: replicas: \"4\" The GitRepo defines which clusters a git repository should be deployed to and the fleet.yaml in the repository determines how the resources are customized per target. All clusters and cluster groups in the same namespace as the GitRepo will be evaluated against all targets of that GitRepo. The targets list is evaluated one by one and if there is a match the resource will be deployed to the cluster. If no match is made against the target list on the GitRepo then the resources will not be deployed to that cluster. Once a target cluster is matched the fleet.yaml from the git repository is then consulted for customizations. The targetCustomizations in the fleet.yaml will be evaluated one by one and the first match will define how the resource is to be configured. If no match is made the resources will be deployed with no additional customizations. There are three approaches to matching clusters for both GitRepo targets and fleet.yaml targetCustomizations. One can use cluster selectors, cluster group selectors, or an explicit cluster group name. All criteria is additive so the final match is evaluated as \"clusterSelector && clusterGroupSelector && clusterGroup\". If any of the three have the default value it is dropped from the criteria. The default value is either null or \"\". It is important to realize that the value {} for a selector means \"match everything.\" targetCustomizations: - name: all # Match everything clusterSelector: {} - name: none # Selector ignored clusterSelector: null When matching a cluster by name, make sure to use the name of the clusters.fleet.cattle.io resource. The Rancher UI also has a provisioning and a management cluster resource. Since the management cluster resource is not namespaced, its name is different and contains a random suffix. targetCustomizations: - name: prod clusterName: fleetname See Mapping to Downstream Clusters for more information and a list of supported customizations. When using Kustomize or Helm the kustomization.yaml or the helm.values will control how the resource are customized per target cluster. If you are using raw YAML then the following simple mechanism is built-in and can be used. The overlays/ folder in the git repo is treated specially as folder containing folders that can be selected to overlay on top per target cluster. The resource overlay content uses a file name based approach. This is different from kustomize which uses a resource based approach. In kustomize the resource Group, Kind, Version, Name, and Namespace identify resources and are then merged or patched. For Fleet the overlay resources will override or patch content with a matching file name. # Base files deployment.yaml svc.yaml # Overlay files # The following file will be added overlays/custom/configmap.yaml # The following file will replace svc.yaml overlays/custom/svc.yaml # The following file will patch deployment.yaml overlays/custom/deployment_patch.yaml A file named foo will replace a file called foo from the base resources or a previous overlay. In order to patch the contents of a file the convention of adding _patch. (notice the trailing period) to the filename is used. The string _patch. will be replaced with . from the file name and that will be used as the target. For example deployment_patch.yaml will target deployment.yaml. The patch will be applied using JSON Merge, Strategic Merge Patch, or JSON Patch. Which strategy is used is based on the file content. Even though JSON strategies are used, the files can be written using YAML syntax. See Cluster and Bundle state. Nested GitRepo CRs (defining a GitRepo that points to a repository containing one or more GitRepo resources) is supported. You can use this feature to take advantage of GitOps in your GitRepo resources or, for example, to split complex scenarios into more than one GitRepo resource. When finding a GitRepo in a Bundle SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery will simply deploy it as any other resource.

Users can deploy bundles, which can be comprised of deployment manifests or any other Kubernetes resource, across clusters using grouping configuration. Multi-cluster Only: This approach only applies if you are running SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in a multi-cluster style If no targets are specified, i.e. when using a single-cluster, the bundles target the default cluster group. When deploying GitRepos to downstream clusters the clusters must be mapped to a target. The deployment targets of GitRepo is done using the spec.targets field to match clusters or cluster groups. The YAML specification is as below. kind: GitRepo apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 metadata: name: myrepo namespace: clusters spec: repo: https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples paths: - simple # Targets are evaluated in order and the first one to match is used. If # no targets match then the evaluated cluster will not be deployed to. targets: # The name of target. This value is largely for display and logging. # If not specified a default name of the format \"target000\" will be used - name: prod # A selector used to match clusters. The structure is the standard # metav1.LabelSelector format. If clusterGroupSelector or clusterGroup is specified, # clusterSelector will be used only to further refine the selection after # clusterGroupSelector and clusterGroup is evaluated. clusterSelector: matchLabels: env: prod # A selector used to match cluster groups. clusterGroupSelector: matchLabels: region: us-east # A specific clusterGroup by name that will be selected clusterGroup: group1 # A specific cluster by name that will be selected clusterName: cluster1 All clusters and cluster groups in the same namespace as the GitRepo will be evaluated against all targets. If any of the targets match the cluster then the GitRepo will be deployed to the downstream cluster. If no match is made, then the GitRepo will not be deployed to that cluster. There are three approaches to matching clusters. One can use cluster selectors, cluster group selectors, or an explicit cluster group name. All criteria is additive so the final match is evaluated as \"clusterSelector && clusterGroupSelector && clusterGroup\". If any of the three have the default value it is dropped from the criteria. The default value is either null or \"\". It is important to realize that the value {} for a selector means \"match everything.\" targets: # Match everything - clusterSelector: {} # Selector ignored - clusterSelector: null You can also match clusters by name: targets: - clusterName: fleetname When using SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in Rancher, make sure to put the name of the clusters.fleet.cattle.io resource. If no target is set for the GitRepo then the default targets value is applied. The default targets value is as below. targets: - name: default clusterGroup: default This means if you wish to setup a default location non-configured GitRepos will go to, then just create a cluster group called default and add clusters to it. The targets: in the GitRepo resource select clusters to deploy on. The targetCustomizations: in fleet.yaml override Helm values only and do not change targeting. To demonstrate how to deploy Kubernetes manifests across different clusters with customization using Fleet, we will use multi-cluster/helm/fleet.yaml. Situation: User has three clusters with three different labels: env=dev, env=test, and env=prod. User wants to deploy a frontend application with a backend database across these clusters. Expected behavior: After deploying to the dev cluster, database replication is not enabled. After deploying to the test cluster, database replication is enabled. After deploying to the prod cluster, database replication is enabled and Load balancer services are exposed. Advantage of Fleet: Instead of deploying the app on each cluster, SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery allows you to deploy across all clusters following these steps: Deploy gitRepo https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples.git and specify the path multi-cluster/helm. Under multi-cluster/helm, a Helm chart will deploy the frontend app service and backend database service. The following rule will be defined in fleet.yaml: targetCustomizations: - name: dev helm: values: replication: false clusterSelector: matchLabels: env: dev - name: test helm: values: replicas: 3 clusterSelector: matchLabels: env: test - name: prod helm: values: serviceType: LoadBalancer replicas: 3 clusterSelector: matchLabels: env: prod Result: SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery will deploy the Helm chart with your customized values.yaml to the different clusters. Configuration management is not limited to deployments but can be expanded to general configuration management. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery is able to apply configuration management through customization among any set of clusters automatically. DefaultNamespace ForceSyncGeneration KeepResources ServiceAccount TargetNamespace Helm.Atomic Helm.Chart Helm.DisablePreProcess Helm.Force Helm.ReleaseName Helm.Repo Helm.TakeOwnership Helm.TimeoutSeconds Helm.ValuesFrom Helm.Values Helm.Version important information Overriding the version of a Helm chart via target customizations will lead to bundles containing all versions, ie the default one and the custom one(s), of the chart, to accommodate all clusters. This in turn means that SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery will deploy larger bundles. + As SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery stores bundles via etcd, this may cause issues on some clusters where resultant bundle sizes may exceed etcd’s configured maximum blob size.

SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery focuses not only on the ability to scale, but it also gives users a high degree of control and visibility to monitor exactly what is installed on the cluster. Deployment management: SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery can manage deployments from git of raw Kubernetes YAML, Helm charts, Kustomize, or any combination of the three. Regardless of the source, all resources are dynamically turned into Helm charts, and Helm is used as the engine to deploy all resources in the cluster. As a result, users can enjoy a high degree of control, consistency, and auditability of their clusters. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery is fundamentally a set of Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) and controllers that manage GitOps for a single Kubernetes cluster or a large scale deployment of Kubernetes clusters.

The single cluster install is for if you wish to use GitOps to manage a single cluster, in which case you do not need a centralized manager cluster. In the multi-cluster use case you will setup a centralized manager cluster to which you can register clusters. If you are just learning SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery the single cluster install is the recommended starting point. After which you can move from single cluster to multi-cluster setup down the line. Single-cluster is the default installation. The same cluster will run both the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager and the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery agent. The cluster will communicate with Git server to deploy resources to this local cluster. This is the simplest setup and very useful for dev/test and small scale setups. This use case is supported as a valid use case for production. Helm 3 Kubernetes SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery is distributed as a Helm chart. Helm 3 is a CLI, has no server side component, and is fairly straight forward. To install the Helm 3 CLI follow the official install instructions. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery is a controller running on a Kubernetes cluster so an existing cluster is required. For the single cluster use case you will install SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery to the cluster which you intend to manage with GitOps. Any Kubernetes community supported version of Kubernetes will work, in practice this means 1.20.5 or greater. Install the following two Helm charts. Install Verify SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in Rancher Rancher has separate helm charts for SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery and uses a different repository.

From 0.10 onwards, SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery supports static sharding. Each shard is defined by its shard ID. Optionally, a shard can have a node selector, instructing SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery to create all controller pods and jobs for that shard on nodes matching that selector. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller chart can be installed with the following arguments: --set shards[$index].id=$shard_id --set shards[$index].nodeSelector.$key=$value This will result in: as many SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller and gitjob deployments as specified unique shard IDs, plus the usual unsharded SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller pod. That latter pod will be the only one containing agent management and cleanup containers. For instance: $ helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait fleet fleet/fleet \\ --set shards[0].id=foo \\ --set shards[0].nodeSelector.\"kubernetes\\.io/hostname\"=k3d-upstream-server-0 \\ --set shards[1].id=bar \\ --set shards[1].nodeSelector.\"kubernetes\\.io/hostname\"=k3d-upstream-server-1 \\ --set shards[2].id=baz \\ --set shards[2].nodeSelector.\"kubernetes\\.io/hostname\"=k3d-upstream-server-2 \\ $ kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system get pods -l app=fleet-controller \\ -o=custom-columns='Name:.metadata.name,Shard-ID:.metadata.labels.fleet\\.cattle\\.io/shard-id,Node:spec.nodeName' Name Shard-ID Node fleet-controller-b4c469c85-rj2q8 k3d-upstream-server-2 fleet-controller-shard-bar-5f5999958f-nt4bm bar k3d-upstream-server-1 fleet-controller-shard-baz-75c8587898-2wkk9 baz k3d-upstream-server-2 fleet-controller-shard-foo-55478fb9d8-42q2f foo k3d-upstream-server-0 $ kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system get pods -l app=gitjob \\ -o=custom-columns='Name:.metadata.name,Shard-ID:.metadata.labels.fleet\\.cattle\\.io/shard-id,Node:spec.nodeName' Name Shard-ID Node gitjob-8498c6d78b-mdhgh k3d-upstream-server-1 gitjob-shard-bar-8659ffc945-9vtlx bar k3d-upstream-server-1 gitjob-shard-baz-6d67f596dc-fsz9m baz k3d-upstream-server-2 gitjob-shard-foo-8697bb7f67-wzsfj foo k3d-upstream-server-0 With sharding in place, each SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller will process resources bearing its own shard ID. This also holds for the unsharded controller, which has no set shard ID and will therefore process all unsharded resources. To deploy a GitRepo for a specific shard, simply add label fleet.cattle.io/shard-ref with your desired shard ID as a value. Here is an example: $ kubectl apply -n fleet-local -f - ca.pem Next, retrieve the CA certificate from your kubeconfig.

If you do not get either of these results than please ensure you have the correct URL. The API server port is typically 6443 for Kubernetes. Next validate that the CA certificate is proper by running the below command. If your API server is signed by a well known CA then omit the --cacert \"$API_SERVER_CA\" part of the command. curl -fL --cacert \"$API_SERVER_CA\" \"$API_SERVER_URL/version\" If you get a valid JSON response or an 401 Unauthorized then it worked. The Unauthorized error is only because the curl command is not setting proper credentials, but this validates that the TLS connection work and the ca.pem is correct for this URL. If you get a SSL certificate problem then the ca.pem is not correct.

One addition on top of RBAC is the GitRepoRestriction resource, which can be used to control GitRepo resources in a namespace. A multi-user fleet setup looks like this: tenants don’t share namespaces, each tenant has one or more namespaces on the upstream cluster, where they can create GitRepo resources tenants can’t deploy cluster wide resources and are limited to a set of namespaces on downstream clusters clusters are in a separate namespace important information The isolation of tenants is not complete and relies on Kubernetes RBAC to be set up correctly. Without manual setup from an operator tenants can still deploy cluster wide resources. Even with the available SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery restrictions, users are only restricted to namespaces, but namespaces don’t provide much isolation on their own. E.g. they can still consume as many resources as they like. However, the existing SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery restrictions allow users to share clusters, and deploy resources without conflicts. This would create a user 'fleetuser', who can only manage GitRepo resources in the 'project1' namespace. kubectl create serviceaccount fleetuser kubectl create namespace project1 kubectl create -n project1 role fleetuser --verb=get --verb=list --verb=create --verb=delete --resource=gitrepos.fleet.cattle.io kubectl create -n project1 rolebinding fleetuser --serviceaccount=default:fleetuser --role=fleetuser If we want to give access to multiple namespaces, we can use a single cluster role with two role bindings: kubectl create clusterrole fleetuser --verb=get --verb=list --verb=create --verb=delete --resource=gitrepos.fleet.cattle.io kubectl create -n project1 rolebinding fleetuser --serviceaccount=default:fleetuser --clusterrole=fleetuser kubectl create -n project2 rolebinding fleetuser --serviceaccount=default:fleetuser --clusterrole=fleetuser This makes sure, tenants can’t interfere with GitRepo resources from other tenants, since they don’t have access to their namespaces. Users belonging to a specific group/organization within the company, may want to disable visibility of their clusters to users from other groups/organizations of the same company. In order to achieve this isolation, Rancher provides GlobalRoles to allow permissions to the users on certain Kubernetes resources. GlobalRoles have the ability to limit access to specific namespaces present on the cluster, thanks to NamespacedRules. When a new fleet workspace is created, a corresponding namespace with an identical name is automatically generated within the Rancher local cluster. For a user to see and deploy fleet resources in a specific workspace, they need at least the following permissions: list/get the fleetworkspace cluster-wide resource in the local cluster Permissions to create fleet resources (such as bundles, gitrepos, …​) in the backing namespace for the workspace in the local cluster. Let’s grant permissions to deploy fleet resources in the project1 and project2 fleet workspaces: To create the project1 and project2 fleet workspaces, you can either do it in the Rancher UI or use the following YAML resources: apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3 kind: FleetWorkspace metadata: name: project1 apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3 kind: FleetWorkspace metadata: name: project2 Create a GlobalRole that grants permission to deploy fleet resources in the project1 and project2 fleet workspaces: apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3 kind: GlobalRole metadata: name: fleet-projects1and2 namespacedRules: project1: - apiGroups: - fleet.cattle.io resources: - gitrepos - bundles - clusterregistrationtokens - gitreporestrictions - clusters - clustergroups verbs: - '*' project2: - apiGroups: - fleet.cattle.io resources: - gitrepos - bundles - clusterregistrationtokens - gitreporestrictions - clusters - clustergroups verbs: - '*' rules: - apiGroups: - management.cattle.io resourceNames: - project1 - project2 resources: - fleetworkspaces verbs: - '*' Assign the GlobalRole to users or groups, more info can be found in the Rancher docs The user now has access to the Continuous Delivery tab in Rancher and can deploy resources to both the project1 and project2 workspaces. In order to have a well organized environment, each workspace should have its own related GlobalRole to help with the separation of duties and isolation required by the customer. This way, each user can be assigned to one or more GlobalRoles, depending on the needs. This assumes all GitRepos created by 'fleetuser' have the team: one label. Different labels could be used, to select different cluster namespaces. In each of the user’s namespaces, as an admin create a BundleNamespaceMapping. kind: BundleNamespaceMapping apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 metadata: name: mapping namespace: project1 # Bundles to match by label. # The labels are defined in the fleet.yaml # labels field or from the # GitRepo metadata.labels field bundleSelector: matchLabels: team: one # or target one repo #fleet.cattle.io/repo-name: simpleapp # Namespaces, containing clusters, to match by label namespaceSelector: matchLabels: kubernetes.io/metadata.name: fleet-default # the label is on the namespace #workspace: prod The target section in the GitRepo resource can be used to deploy only to a subset of the matched clusters. Admins can further restrict tenants by creating a GitRepoRestriction in each of their namespaces. kind: GitRepoRestriction apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 metadata: name: restriction namespace: project1 allowedTargetNamespaces: - project1simpleapp This will deny the creation of cluster wide resources, which may interfere with other tenants and limit the deployment to the 'project1simpleapp' namespace. A GitRepo resource created by a tenant, without admin access could look like this: kind: GitRepo apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 metadata: name: simpleapp namespace: project1 labels: team: one spec: repo: https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples paths: - bundle-diffs targetNamespace: project1simpleapp # do not match the upstream/local cluster, won't work targets: - name: dev clusterSelector: matchLabels: env: dev This includes the team: one label and and the required targetNamespace. Together with the previous BundleNamespaceMapping it would target all clusters with a env: dev label in the 'fleet-default' namespace. BundleNamespaceMappings do not work with local clusters, so make sure not to target them.","title":"Setup Multi User","component":"continuous-delivery","version":"v0.12","name":"multi-user","url":"/continuous-delivery/v0.12/en/multi-user.html","titles":[{"text":"Example SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Standalone","hash":"_example_suse_rancher_prime_continuous_delivery_standalone","id":1},{"text":"Isolated Workspaces in Rancher","hash":"_isolated_workspaces_in_rancher","id":2},{"text":"Allow Access to Clusters","hash":"_allow_access_to_clusters","id":3},{"text":"Restricting Access to Downstream Clusters","hash":"_restricting_access_to_downstream_clusters","id":4},{"text":"An Example GitRepo Resource","hash":"_an_example_gitrepo_resource","id":5}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"When deploying a SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery bundle, the specified namespace will automatically be created if it does not already exist. When configuring workload namespaces, it is important to be aware that certain options are designed to override the values of other options or namespace definitions in workload resources. In some cases, setting namespaces using some options may result in errors if the resources to be deployed contain non-namespaced resources. To get a better understanding of how these options interact, refer to the diagram below. For more details on a specific option, please refer to the GitRepo or fleet.yaml reference. It is possible to create a GitRepo that will deploy across namespaces. The primary purpose of this is so that a central privileged team can manage common configuration for many clusters that are managed by different teams. The way this is accomplished is by creating a BundleNamespaceMapping resource in a cluster. If you are creating a BundleNamespaceMapping resource it is best to do it in a namespace that only contains GitRepos and no Clusters. It seems to get confusing if you have Clusters in the same repo as the cross namespace GitRepos will still always be evaluated against the current namespace. So if you have clusters in the same namespace you may wish to make them canary clusters. A BundleNamespaceMapping has only two fields. Which are as below kind: BundleNamespaceMapping apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 metadata: name: not-important namespace: typically-unique # Bundles to match by label. The labels are defined in the fleet.yaml # labels field or from the GitRepo metadata.labels field bundleSelector: matchLabels: foo: bar # Namespaces to match by label namespaceSelector: matchLabels: foo: bar If the BundleNamespaceMappings bundleSelector field matches a Bundles labels then that Bundle target criteria will be evaluated against all clusters in all namespaces that match namespaceSelector. One can specify labels for the created bundles from git by putting labels in the fleet.yaml file or on the metadata.labels field on the GitRepo. A namespace can contain multiple GitRepoRestriction resources. All GitRepos created in that namespace will be checked against the list of restrictions. If a GitRepo violates one of the constraints its BundleDeployment will be in an error state and won’t be deployed. This can also be used to set the defaults for GitRepo’s serviceAccount and clientSecretName fields. kind: GitRepoRestriction apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1 metadata: name: restriction namespace: typically-unique allowedClientSecretNames: [] allowedRepoPatterns: [] allowedServiceAccounts: [] allowedTargetNamespaces: [] defaultClientSecretName: \"\" defaultServiceAccount: \"\" This can be used to limit a deployment to a set of namespaces on a downstream cluster. If an allowedTargetNamespaces restriction is present, all GitRepos must specify a targetNamespace and the specified namespace must be in the allow list. This also prevents the creation of cluster wide resources. All types in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager are namespaced. The namespaces of a custom resource, e.g. GitRepo, does not influence the namespace of deployed resources. Understanding how namespaces are used in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager is important to understand the security model and how one can use SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in a multi-tenant fashion. All selectors for GitRepo targets will be evaluated against the Clusters and ClusterGroups in the same namespaces. This means that if you give create or update privileges to a GitRepo type in a namespace, that end user can modify the selector to match any cluster in that namespace. This means in practice if you want to have two teams self manage their own GitRepo registrations but they should not be able to target each others clusters, they should be in different namespaces. The cluster registration namespace, called 'workspace' in Rancher, contains the Cluster and the ClusterRegistration resources, as well as any GitRepos and Bundles. Rancher will create two SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery workspaces: fleet-default and fleet-local. fleet-default will contain all the downstream clusters that are already registered through Rancher. fleet-local will contain the local cluster by default. Access to fleet-local is limited. Important Information Deleting the workspace, cluster registration namespace, will delete all the clusters within that namespace. This will uninstall all deployed bundles, except for the fleet agent, from the deleted clusters. If you are using SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in a single cluster style, the namespace will always be fleet-local. Refer to the fleet-local namespaces section for more information. For a multi-cluster style, please ensure you use the correct repo that will map to the right target clusters. The fleet-local namespace is a special namespace used for the single cluster use case or to bootstrap the configuration of the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager. Access to the local cluster should be limited to operators. When fleet is installed the fleet-local namespace is created along with one Cluster called local and one ClusterGroup called default. If no targets are specified on a GitRepo, it is by default targeted to the ClusterGroup named default. This means that all GitRepos created in fleet-local will automatically target the local Cluster. The local Cluster refers to the cluster the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager is running on. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller and SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery agent run in this namespace. All service accounts referenced by GitRepos are expected to live in this namespace in the downstream cluster. This namespace holds secrets for the cluster registration process. It should contain no other resources in it, especially secrets. For every cluster that is registered a namespace is created by the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery manager for that cluster. These namespaces are named in the form cluster-${namespace}-${cluster}-${random}. The purpose of this namespace is that all BundleDeployments for that cluster are put into this namespace and then the downstream cluster is given access to watch and update BundleDeployments in that namespace only.","title":"Namespaces","component":"continuous-delivery","version":"v0.12","name":"namespaces","url":"/continuous-delivery/v0.12/en/namespaces.html","titles":[{"text":"Workload Namespaces","hash":"_workload_namespaces","id":1},{"text":"Namespace Creation Behavior in Bundles","hash":"_namespace_creation_behavior_in_bundles","id":2},{"text":"Configuring Workload Namespaces","hash":"_configuring_workload_namespaces","id":3},{"text":"Cross Namespace Deployments","hash":"_cross_namespace_deployments","id":4},{"text":"Restricting GitRepos","hash":"_restricting_gitrepos","id":5},{"text":"Allowed Target Namespaces","hash":"_allowed_target_namespaces","id":6},{"text":"SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Namespaces","hash":"_suse_rancher_prime_continuous_delivery_namespaces","id":7},{"text":"GitRepos, Bundles, Clusters, ClusterGroups","hash":"_gitrepos_bundles_clusters_clustergroups","id":8},{"text":"Internal Namespaces","hash":"_internal_namespaces","id":9},{"text":"Cluster Registration Namespace: fleet-local","hash":"_cluster_registration_namespace_fleet_local","id":10},{"text":"System Namespace: cattle-fleet-system","hash":"_system_namespace_cattle_fleet_system","id":11},{"text":"System Registration Namespace: cattle-fleet-clusters-system","hash":"_system_registration_namespace_cattle_fleet_clusters_system","id":12},{"text":"Cluster Namespaces","hash":"_cluster_namespaces","id":13}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"Fleet reports most information via status fields on its custom resources.

Fleet is not limited by etcd size limitations. However, Fleet needs write access to a registry and that registry needs to be accessible by the agents in downstream clusters. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery stores by default the bundle resources in etcd twice. This is done via the k8s API and there is a size limit, depending on the etcd configuration. This feature will allow users to choose an OCI registry as storage for bundle resources. The bundle resource will have an empty resource list and a reference to the OCI repository server. The bundledeployment will not point to a content resource, but to an OCI repository server instead.

When a GitRepo is scanned it will produce one or more bundles. To demonstrate the life cycle of a SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery bundle, we will use multi-cluster/helm as a case study. User will create a GitRepo that points to the multi-cluster/helm repository. The gitjob-controller will sync changes from the GitRepo and detect changes from the polling or webhook event. With every commit change, the gitjob-controller will create a job that clones the git repository, reads content from the repo such as fleet.yaml and other manifests, and creates the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery bundle. The job pod with the image name rancher/tekton-utils will be under the same namespace as the GitRepo. The fleet-controller then syncs changes from the bundle. According to the targets, the fleet-controller will create BundleDeployment resources, which are a combination of a bundle and a target cluster. The fleet-agent will then pull the BundleDeployment from the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controlplane. The agent deploys bundle manifests as a Helm chart from the BundleDeployment into the downstream clusters. The fleet-agent will continue to monitor the application bundle and report statuses back in the following order: bundledeployment > bundle > GitRepo > cluster. This diagram shows the different rendering stages a bundle goes through until deployment. Several fleet CLI commands help with debugging bundles. Apply renders a folder with Kubernetes resources, such as a Helm chart, manifests, or kustomize folders, into a SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery bundle resource. git clone https://github.com/rancher/fleet-test-data cd fleet-test-data fleet apply -n fleet-local -o bundle.yaml testbundle simple-chart/ More information on how to create bundles with fleet apply can be found in the section on bundles. Target reads a bundle from a file and works with a live cluster to print out the bundledeployment & content resource, which fleetcontroller would create. It takes a namespace as an argument, so it can look in that namespace for e.g. cluster resources. It can also dump the data structure which is used during \"targeting\", so decisions taken regarding labels and cluster names can be checked. Deploy takes the output of fleet target, or a dumped bundledeployment/content resource and deploys it to a cluster, just like fleet-agent would. It supports a dry run mode, to print out the resources which would be created, instead of installing them with helm. Since the command doesn’t create the input resources, a running fleet-agent would likely garbage collect the deployment. The deploy command can be used to bring bundles to air-gapped clusters. git clone https://github.com/rancher/fleet-test-data cd fleet-test-data fleet apply -n fleet-local -o bundle.yaml testbundle simple-chart/ fleet target --bundle-file bundle.yaml --list-inputs > bd.yaml fleet deploy --input-file bd.yaml --dry-run For information about apply, refer to Create a Bundle Resource.","title":"Bundle Lifecycle","component":"continuous-delivery","version":"v0.12","name":"ref-bundle-stages","url":"/continuous-delivery/v0.12/en/ref-bundle-stages.html","titles":[{"text":"Examining the Bundle Lifecycle With the CLI","hash":"_examining_the_bundle_lifecycle_with_the_cli","id":1},{"text":"fleet apply","hash":"_fleet_apply","id":2},{"text":"fleet target","hash":"_fleet_target","id":3},{"text":"fleet deploy","hash":"_fleet_deploy","id":4},{"text":"Lifecycle CLI Example","hash":"_lifecycle_cli_example","id":5}]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"Bundles are automatically created by SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery when a GitRepo is created.

This can be used to download a tarball of the chart. go-getter also allows to download a chart from a Git repo. a Helm repository, specified by repo and optionally version. an OCI Helm repository, specified by repo and optionally version. Options for the downloaded Helm chart. values valuesFiles valueFrom Values are processed in different stages of the Bundle lifecycle fleet.yaml values: and valuesFile: are added to the bundle’s values when it is created. Helm values templating, e.g. with ${ }, happens when the bundle is targeted at a cluster, with cluster labels filled in, etc. When the agent installs the chart, values from valuesFrom are read. Then Helm templating {{ }} is processed. It is possible to specify the keys and values as go template strings for advanced templating needs. Most of the functions from the sprig templating library are available. This can be turned off in fleet.yaml, by setting disablePreProcess, e.g. to avoid conflicts with other templating languages. Note that if the functions output changes with every call, e.g. uuidv4, the bundle will get redeployed. You can test values templating with the CLI against existing clusters. The template context has the following keys: .ClusterValues are retrieved from target cluster’s spec.templateValues .ClusterLabels and .ClusterAnnotations are the labels and annotations in the cluster resource. .ClusterName as the fleet’s cluster resource name. .ClusterNamespace as the namespace in which the cluster resource exists. To access Labels or Annotations by their key name: ${ get .ClusterLabels \"management.cattle.io/cluster-display-name\" } The fleet.yaml must be valid yaml. Templating uses ${ } as delims, unlike Helm which uses {{ }}. These fleet.yaml template delimiters can be escaped using backticks, eg.: foo-bar-${`${PWD}`} will result in the following text: foo-bar-${PWD} Empty values It is easier to use global.fleet.clusterLabels.LABELNAME instead of templating. When using templating, make sure to protect against null values.

The text ignores agent initiated registration, as it’s not commonly used. Agent initiated registration is \"ClusterRegistrationToken first\", which means pre-creating a cluster is optional. See \"Register Downstream Clusters\" to learn how to register clusters. fleet-controller starts up and may \"bootstrap\" the local cluster resource. In Rancher creating the local cluster resource is handled by the fleetcluster controller instead, but otherwise the process is identical. The process is identical for the local cluster or any downstream cluster. It starts by creating a cluster resource, which refers to a kubeconfig secret. In this step a ClusterRegistationToken and an \"import\" service account are created based on a Cluster resource. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller creates a ClusterRegistrationToken and waits for it to be complete. The ClusterRegistationToken triggers the creation of the \"import\" service account, which can create ClusterRegistrations and read any secret in the system registration namespace (eg \"cattle-fleet-clusters-system\"). The import.go controller will enqueue itself until the \"import\" service account exists, because that account is needed to create the fleet-agent-bootstrap secret. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller will now create the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery agent deployment and the bootstrap secret on the downstream cluster. The bootstrap secret contains the API server URL of the upstream cluster and is used to build a kubeconfig to access the upstream cluster. Both values are taken from the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller config configmap. That configmap is part of the helm chart. The agent uses the \"import\" account to upgrade to a request account. Immediately the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery agent checks for a fleet-agent-bootstrap secret. If the bootstrap secret, which contains the \"import\" kubeconfig, is present the agent starts registering. Then agent creates the final ClusterRegistration resource in fleet-default on the management cluster, with a random number. The random number will be used for the registration secret’s name. The SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller triggers and tries to grant the ClusterRegistration request to create agent’s service account and create the 'c-*' registration secret with the client’s new kubeconfig. The registration secret name is hash(\"clientID-clientRandom\"). The new kubeconfig uses the \"request\" account. The \"request\" account can access the cluster status, BundleDeployments and Contents. At this point the agent is fully registered and will persist the \"request\" account into a fleet-agent secret. The API server URL and CA are copied from the bootstrap secret, which inherited these values from the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller’s Helm chart values. The bootstrap secret is deleted. When the agent restarts, it will not re-register, since the bootstrap secret is missing. The agent starts watching its Cluster Namespace\" for BundleDeployments. At this point the agent is ready to deploy workloads. The registration starts with the \"import\" account and pivots to the \"request\" account. The fleet-default namespace has all the cluster registrations, the \"import\" account uses a separate namespace. Once the agent is registered, fleet-controller will trigger on a cluster or namespace change. The manageagent controller will then create a bundle to adopt the existing agent deployment. The agent will update itself to the bundle and since the \"generation\" environment variable changes, it will restart. If no bootstrap secret exists, the agent will not re-register. Detailed analysis of the registration process for clusters. This shows the interaction of controllers, resources and service accounts during the registration of a new downstream cluster or the local cluster. It is important to note that there are multiple ways to start this: Creating a bootstrap config. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery does this for the local agent. Creating a Cluster resource with a kubeconfig. Rancher does this for downstream clusters. See manager-initiated registration. Create a ClusterRegistrationToken resource, optionally create a Cluster resource for a pre-defined (clientID) cluster. See agent-initiated registration. This diagram shows the resources created during registration and focuses on the k8s API server configuration. The import.go controller triggers on Cluster creation/update events and deploys the agent. This image shows how the API server URL and CA propagates through the secrets during registration: The arrows in the diagram show how the API server values are copied from the Helm values to the cluster registration secret on the upstream cluster and finally downstream to the bootstrap secret of the agent. There is one special case, if the agent is for the local/\"bootstrap\" cluster, the server values also exist in the kubeconfig secret, referenced by the Cluster resource. In this case the kubeconfig secret contains the upstream server URL and CA, next to the downstream’s kubeconfig. If the settings are present in the kubeconfig secret, they override the configured values. Rancher installs the fleet helm chart. The API server URL and CA are derived from Rancher’s settings. SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery will pass these values to a SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery agent, so it can connect back to the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery controller. When the user runs curl | kubectl apply, the applied manifest includes the rancher agent deployment. The deployment contains a secret cattle-credentials- which contains the API URL and a token. The Rancher agent starts up and reports downstream’s kubeconfig to upstream. Rancher then creates the fleet Cluster resource, which references a kubeconfig secret. 👉SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery will use this kubeconfig to deploy the agent on the downstream cluster.","title":"Cluster Registration Internals","component":"continuous-delivery","version":"v0.12","name":"ref-registration","url":"/continuous-delivery/v0.12/en/ref-registration.html","titles":[{"text":"How does cluster registration work?","hash":"_how_does_cluster_registration_work","id":1},{"text":"Cluster first","hash":"_cluster_first","id":2},{"text":"Creating the Bootstrap Secret for the Downstream Cluster","hash":"_creating_the_bootstrap_secret_for_the_downstream_cluster","id":3},{"text":"Creating the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Agent Deployment","hash":"_creating_the_suse_rancher_prime_continuous_delivery_agent_deployment","id":4},{"text":"SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Agent Starts Registration, Upgrades to Request Account","hash":"_suse_rancher_prime_continuous_delivery_agent_starts_registration_upgrades_to_request_account","id":5},{"text":"SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Agent is Registered, Watches for BundleDeployments","hash":"_suse_rancher_prime_continuous_delivery_agent_is_registered_watches_for_bundledeployments","id":6},{"text":"Notes","hash":"_notes","id":7},{"text":"Diagram","hash":"_diagram","id":8},{"text":"Registration Process and Controllers","hash":"_registration_process_and_controllers","id":9},{"text":"Secrets during Agent Deployment","hash":"_secrets_during_agent_deployment","id":10},{"text":"SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery Cluster Registration in Rancher","hash":"_suse_rancher_prime_continuous_delivery_cluster_registration_in_rancher","id":11},{"text":"Import Cluster into Rancher","hash":"_import_cluster_into_rancher","id":12}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"After installing SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery in Rancher these resources are created in the upstream cluster.

The first things to check when Fleet behaves unexpectedly would be: fleet-controller logs on the management cluster: has Fleet failed to reconcile any resource’s (bundle, bundle deployment) current state with its expected state? gitjob pod logs on the management cluster: has Fleet encountered any issue while creating jobs to generate new bundles for new commits found in monitored git repositories? status of the GitRepo for which resources are not properly deployed: How many Ready Bundle Deployments does it list? How many bundle deployments are listed as expected? How many do you expect to see? Keep in mind that a GitRepo creates a bundle per path; each bundle leads to as many bundle deployments as there are target clusters. A mismatch between Desired Ready Clusters and your own expectation could point to a targeting issue. Which resources are listed in the GitRepo’s status? Which commit appears in the GitRepo’s status? If the issue is specific to a target cluster, users should check the Fleet agent logs on that cluster: has Fleet failed to deploy a bundle deployment on that cluster? The next section explains how to run all these checks. In the local management cluster where the fleet-controller is deployed, run the following command with your specific fleet-controller pod name filled in: $ kubectl logs -l app=fleet-controller -n cattle-fleet-system Go to each downstream cluster and run the following command for the local cluster with your specific fleet-agent pod name filled in: # Downstream cluster $ kubectl logs -l app=fleet-agent -n cattle-fleet-system # Local cluster $ kubectl logs -l app=fleet-agent -n cattle-local-fleet-system Normally, errors should appear in the Rancher UI. However, if there is not enough information displayed about the error there, you can research further by trying one or more of the following as needed: For more information about the bundle, click on bundle, and the YAML mode will be enabled. For more information about the GitRepo, click on GitRepo, then click on View Yaml in the upper right of the screen. After viewing the YAML, check status.conditions; a detailed error message should be displayed here. Check the fleet-controller for synching errors. Check the fleet-agent log in the downstream cluster if you encounter issues when deploying the bundle. For debugging and bug reports the raw JSON of the resources status fields is most useful. This can be accessed in the Rancher UI, or through kubectl: kubectl get bundle -n fleet-local fleet-agent-local -o=jsonpath={.status} kubectl get gitrepo -n fleet-default gitrepo-name -o=jsonpath={.status} To download more resources other than the spec fields: kubectl get clusters.fleet.cattle.io -A -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.namespace}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels}{\"\\t\"}{.status}{\"\\n\"}{end}' kubectl get bundles -A -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.namespace}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.spec.targets}{\"\\t\"}{.status}{\"\\n\"}{end}' kubectl get gitrepos -A -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.namespace}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.spec.targets}{\"\\t\"}{.status}{\"\\n\"}{end}' Check the fleet-controller logs and the fleet-agent logs. Check the gitjob-controller logs using the following command with your specific gitjob pod name filled in: $ kubectl logs -f $gitjob-pod-name -n cattle-fleet-system Note that there are two containers inside the pod: the step-git-source container that clones the git repo, and the fleet container that applies bundles based on the git repo. The pods will usually have images named rancher/tekton-utils with the gitRepo name as a prefix. Check the logs for these Kubernetes job pods in the local management cluster as follows, filling in your specific gitRepoName pod name and namespace: $ kubectl logs -f $gitRepoName-pod-name -n namespace You can check the status of the fleet-controller pods by running the commands below: kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system logs -l app=fleet-controller kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system get pods -l app=fleet-controller NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE fleet-controller-64f49d756b-n57wq 1/1 Running 0 3m21s Available in Rancher v2.6.3 (SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery v0.3.8), the ability to enable debug logging has been added. Go to the Dashboard, then click on the local cluster in the left navigation menu Select Apps & Marketplace, then Installed Apps from the dropdown From there, you will upgrade the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery chart with the value debug=true. You can also set debugLevel=5 if desired. For CRD terms like clusters and gitrepos, you must reference the full CRD name. For example, the cluster CRD’s complete name is cluster.fleet.cattle.io, and the gitrepo CRD’s complete name is gitrepo.fleet.cattle.io. Bundles, which are created from the GitRepo, follow the pattern $gitrepoName-$path in the same workspace/namespace where the GitRepo was created. Note that $path is the path directory in the git repository that contains the bundle (fleet.yaml). BundleDeployments, which are created from the bundle, follow the pattern $bundleName-$clusterName in the namespace clusters-$workspace-$cluster-$generateHash. Note that $clusterName is the cluster to which the bundle will be deployed. When testing SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery with private git repositories, you will notice that HTTP secrets are no longer supported in Github. To work around this issue, follow these steps: Create a personal access token in Github. In Rancher, create an HTTP secret with your Github username. Use your token as the secret. If your GitJob returns the error below, the problem may be that SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery cannot access the Helm repo you specified in your fleet.yaml: time=\"2021-11-04T09:21:24Z\" level=fatal msg=\"bad response code: 403\" Perform the following steps to assess: Check that your repo is accessible from your dev machine, and that you can download the Helm chart successfully Check that your credentials for the git repo are valid If your GitJob returns the error below, you may have added the wrong certificate chain: time=\"2021-11-11T05:55:08Z\" level=fatal msg=\"Get \\\"https://helm.intra/virtual-helm/index.yaml\\\": x509: certificate signed by unknown authority\" Please verify your certificate with the following command: context=playground-local kubectl get secret -n fleet-default helm-repo -o jsonpath=\"{['data']['cacerts']}\" --context $context | base64 -d | openssl x509 -text -noout Certificate: Data: Version: 3 (0x2) Serial Number: 7a:1e:df:79:5f:b0:e0:be:49:de:11:5e:d9:9c:a9:71 Signature Algorithm: sha512WithRSAEncryption Issuer: C = CH, O = MY COMPANY, CN = NOP Root CA G3 ... When you deploy bundles to Fleet, some of the components are modified, and this causes the \"modified\" flag in the SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery environment. To ignore the modified flag for the differences between the Helm install generated by fleet.yaml and the resource in your cluster, add a diff.comparePatches to the fleet.yaml for your Deployment, as shown in this example: defaultNamespace: helm: releaseName: repo: chart: diff: comparePatches: - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment operations: - {\"op\":\"remove\", \"path\":\"/spec/template/spec/hostNetwork\"} - {\"op\":\"remove\", \"path\":\"/spec/template/spec/nodeSelector\"} jsonPointers: # jsonPointers allows to ignore diffs at certain json path - \"/spec/template/spec/priorityClassName\" - \"/spec/template/spec/tolerations\" To determine which operations should be removed, observe the logs from fleet-agent on the target cluster. You should see entries similar to the following: level=error msg=\"bundle monitoring-monitoring: deployment.apps monitoring/monitoring-monitoring-kube-state-metrics modified {\\\"spec\\\":{\\\"template\\\":{\\\"spec\\\":{\\\"hostNetwork\\\":false}}}}\" Based on the above log, you can add the following entry to remove the operation: {\"op\":\"remove\", \"path\":\"/spec/template/spec/hostNetwork\"} Modified means that there is a mismatch between the actual state and the desired state, the source of truth, which lives in the git repository. Check the bundle diffs documentation for more information. You can also force update the gitrepo to perform a manual resync. Select GitRepo on the left navigation bar, then select Force Update. For bundles with an HPA, the expected state is Modified, as the bundle contains fields that differ from the state of the Bundle at deployment - usually ReplicaSet. You must define a patch in the fleet.yaml to ignore this field according to GitRepo or Bundle stuck in modified state. Here is an example of such a patch for the deployment nginx in namespace default: diff: comparePatches: - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx namespace: default operations: - {\"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/spec/replicas\"} You will need to re-import and restart the registration process: Select Cluster on the left navigation bar, then select Force Update WaitCheckIn status for Rancher v2.5: The cluster will show in WaitCheckIn status because the fleet-controller is attempting to communicate with SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery using the Rancher service IP. However, SUSE® Rancher Prime Continuous Delivery must communicate directly with Rancher via the Kubernetes service DNS using service discovery, not through the proxy. For more, see the Rancher docs. When you see an error like the one below …​ Error opening a gzip reader for /tmp/getter154967024/archive: gzip: invalid header the content of the helm chart is incorrect. Manually download the chart to your local machine and check the content. You can force a redeployment of an agent for a given cluster by setting redeployAgentGeneration. kubectl patch clusters.fleet.cattle.io -n fleet-local local --type=json -p '[{\"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/spec/redeployAgentGeneration\", \"value\": -1}]' Users can create new workspaces and move clusters across workspaces.

This controller is experimental and is not enabled by default. Several log messages have been improved to provide more context and information about the errors that occurred. The conditions in the status fields of resources are used by the UI to display warnings and we are continuously improving them. When a bundle fails to deploy to a cluster, e.g. because the cluster is missing a required label that is to be used as a value, the bundle will now show the affected cluster in the error message. This makes it easier to identify which clusters are affected by the error. The agent has been switched from a StatefulSet to a Deployment. This change allows the agent to scale horizontally and is a step towards making the agent more resilient to failures. The agent now exposes the number of worker goroutines it is running, which can be used to tune the agent’s performance.
